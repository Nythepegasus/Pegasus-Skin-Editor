# TODO
I'm going to mark down a list of things that need done for this editor to be fully functioning
(in my eyes).

- [ ] Create skins directly from application, instead of being forced to edit existing skin.
- [ ] Menu items for various editor commands.
- [ ] 'Highlight' selected regions.
- [ ] An option to export directly to a `.deltaskin` file.
- [ ] A basic photo converter for correctly sized and formatted PDF files.
- [ ] Allow skin makers to utilize the "screens" attribute in skins.
- [ ] (Optionally) Download the default skins to a data directory as a starting point for new skins.
- [X] ~~Ability to name skins, and have it show up in the editor somewhere.~~
- [X] ~~A separate information window that shows the current x, y, width, and height of selected region.~~
- [X] ~~Actual saving and opening of skin projects, whether in directory, or `.deltaskin` form.~~
- [X] ~~The ability to delete and add regions, and define those regions however the skin creator wants, as well as custom buttons.~~
- [X] ~~A better system for determining buttons required for each system, or at least a list of suggestions for makers.~~
