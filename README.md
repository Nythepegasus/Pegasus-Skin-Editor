# Pegasus Skin Editor
This is a little program that i'm trying to put together to aid in the creation of Delta Emulator skin files.
It's still in a very early WIP phase, and things aren't functional whatsoever. Basic displaying
Is all that I have implemented, the actual moving of bounding boxes and other functionality I want to add
has yet to be added.

## Installing
To install, you will probably want to setup a Python virtual environment and then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can run:
```
python3 Editor.py 
```

### TODO
- [ ] Get the rest of the GUI setup, getting the correct elements on click and such.
- [ ] Menu items for the various ways of editing the skin files.
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts need bound, and have decent amount of tools when it comes to editing.
- [ ] Have a set of "default" files for the editor, so you can easily start new projects.
- [ ] ***Lots*** more tbh
