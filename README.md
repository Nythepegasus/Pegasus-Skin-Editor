# Pegasus Skin Editor
This is a little program that i'm trying to put together to aid in the creation of Delta Emulator skin files. It's still in a very early WIP phase, and things aren't functional whatsoever. Basic displaying is all that I have implemented, the actual moving of bounding boxes and other functionality I want to add
has yet to be added.
